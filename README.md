# Challenge 2 Advanced CSS

Our goal this challenge was to create a professional portfolio utilizing advanced css skills. "AS AN employer I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position."

## Keegan Jervis Professional Portfolio

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work <br />
WHEN I load their portfolio <br />
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them <br />
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation <br />
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section <br />
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work <br />
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications <br />
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application <br />
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others <br />
